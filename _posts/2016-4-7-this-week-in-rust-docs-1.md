Hello and welcome to *This Week in Rust Docs*!

*This Week in Rust Docs* is openly developed [on GitHub](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/this-week-in-rust-docs).
If you find any errors in this week's issue, [please submit a PR](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/this-week-in-rust-docs/pulls).

This week's edition was edited by: [GuillaumeGomez](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez).

# Why this newsletter?

There isn't an official Rust docs team yet, but several of us have decided to start working as a team, even though it's not
official. Here's what we'll be working on:

 * Working on the front-end part of rustdoc.
 * Working on error code explanations.
 * Improving Rust documentation.
 * Improving the Rustbook (also known as "The Book").

Since documentation is a really important part of Rust, why not keeping people up-to-date about what's happening?

# Latest news

In the two last weeks, we opened two RFCs:

 * [Normalization for long error codes explanations](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1567)
 * [More api documentation conventions](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1574)

Once they're approved, the work on Rust documentation will certainly increase again. They both intend to normalize how to write specific documentation. Please take a look at them. :)

# Current opened issues

For now, here are the issues opened for Rust documentation:

 * [The Standard Library Documentation Checklist](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
 * [Add error explanations for all error codes](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32777)

They both need help to move forward so any contribution is very welcome!
